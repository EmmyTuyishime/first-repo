<p>perldelta - what is new for perl v5.32.0</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.32.0 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perl5300delta.html">perl5300delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.30.0.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="The-isa-Operator">The isa Operator</h2>

<p>A new experimental infix operator called <code>isa</code> tests whether a given object is an instance of a given class or a class derived from it:</p>

<pre><code>    if( $obj isa Package::Name ) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>For more detail see <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlop.html#Class-Instance-Operator">&quot;Class Instance Operator&quot; in perlop</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Unicode-13.0-is-supported">Unicode 13.0 is supported</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/">https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="Chained-comparisons-capability">Chained comparisons capability</h2>

<p>Some comparison operators, as their associativity, <i>chain</i> with some operators of the same precedence (but never with operators of different precedence).</p>

<pre><code>    if ( $x &lt; $y &lt;= $z ) {...}</code></pre>

<p>behaves exactly like:</p>

<pre><code>    if ( $x &lt; $y &amp;&amp; $y &lt;= $z ) {...}</code></pre>

<p>(assuming that <code>&quot;$y&quot;</code> is as simple a scalar as it looks.)</p>

<p>You can read more about this in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlop.html">perlop</a> under <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlop.html#Operator-Precedence-and-Associativity">&quot;Operator Precedence and Associativity&quot; in perlop</a>.</p>

<h2 id="New-Unicode-properties-Identifier_Status-and-Identifier_Type-supported">New Unicode properties <code>Identifier_Status</code> and <code>Identifier_Type</code> supported</h2>

<p>Unicode is in the process of revising its regular expression requirements: <a href="https://www.unicode.org/draft/reports/tr18/tr18.html">https://www.unicode.org/draft/reports/tr18/tr18.html</a>. As part of that they are wanting more properties to be exposed, ones that aren&#39;t part of the strict UCD (Unicode character database). These two are used for examining inputs for security purposes. Details on their usage is at <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/proposed.html">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/proposed.html</a>.</p>

<h2 id="It-is-now-possible-to-write-qr-p-Name-...-or-qr-p-na-SMILING-GRINNING-FACE">It is now possible to write <code>qr/\p{Name=...}/</code>, or <code>qr!\p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!</code></h2>

<p>The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression patterns, as an alternative to <code>\N{...}</code>. A comparison of the two methods is given in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#Comparison-of-N-...-and-p-name">&quot;Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}&quot; in perlunicode</a>.</p>

<p>The second example above shows that wildcard subpatterns are also usable in this property. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#Wildcards-in-Property-Values">&quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in perlunicode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Improvement-of-POSIX::mblen-mbtowc-and-wctomb">Improvement of <code>POSIX::mblen()</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and <code>wctomb</code></h2>

<p>The <code>POSIX::mblen()</code>, <code>mbtowc</code>, and <code>wctomb</code> functions now work on shift state locales and are thread-safe on C99 and above compilers when executed on a platform that has locale thread-safety; the length parameters are now optional.</p>

<p>These functions are always executed under the current C language locale. (See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perllocale.html">perllocale</a>.) Most locales are stateless, but a few, notably the very rarely encountered ISO 2022, maintain a state between calls to these functions. Previously the state was cleared on every call, but now the state is not reset unless the appropriate parameter is <code>undef</code>.</p>

<p>On threaded perls, the C99 functions <a href="http://man.he.net/man3/mbrlen">mbrlen(3)</a>, <a href="http://man.he.net/man3/mbrtowc">mbrtowc(3)</a>, and <a href="http://man.he.net/man3/wcrtomb">wcrtomb(3)</a>, when available, are substituted for the plain functions. This makes these functions thread-safe when executing on a locale thread-safe platform.</p>

<p>The string length parameters in <code>mblen</code> and <code>mbtowc</code> are now optional; useful only if you wish to restrict the length parsed in the source string to less than the actual length.</p>

<h2 id="Alpha-assertions-are-no-longer-experimental">Alpha assertions are no longer experimental</h2>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#pla:pattern">&quot;(*pla:pattern)&quot; in perlre</a>, <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#plb:pattern">&quot;(*plb:pattern)&quot; in perlre</a>, <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#nla:pattern">&quot;(*nla:pattern)&quot; in perlre</a>&gt;, and <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#nlb:pattern">&quot;(*nlb:pattern)&quot; in perlre</a>. Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables the warning category <code>experimental::alpha_assertions</code> will continue to work without any changes needed. Enabling the category has no effect.</p>

<h2 id="Script-runs-are-no-longer-experimental">Script runs are no longer experimental</h2>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#Script-Runs">&quot;Script Runs&quot; in perlre</a>. Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables the warning category <code>experimental::script_run</code> will continue to work without any changes needed. Enabling the category has no effect.</p>

<h2 id="Feature-checks-are-now-faster">Feature checks are now faster</h2>

<p>Previously feature checks in the parser required a hash lookup when features were set outside of a feature bundle, this has been optimized to a bit mask check. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17229">GH #17229</a>]</p>

<h2 id="Perl-is-now-developed-on-GitHub">Perl is now developed on GitHub</h2>

<p>Perl is now developed on GitHub. You can find us at <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5">https://github.com/Perl/perl5</a>.</p>

<p>Non-security bugs should now be reported via GitHub. Security issues should continue to be reported as documented in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Compiled-patterns-can-now-be-dumped-before-optimization">Compiled patterns can now be dumped before optimization</h2>

<p>This is primarily useful for tracking down bugs in the regular expression compiler. This dump happens on <code>-DDEBUGGING</code> perls, if you specify <code>-Drv</code> on the command line; or on any perl if the pattern is compiled within the scope of <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use re qw(Debug DUMP_PRE_OPTIMIZE)</code></span> or <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use re qw(Debug COMPILE EXTRA)</code></span>. (All but the second case display other information as well.)</p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<h2 id="CVE-2020-10543-Buffer-overflow-caused-by-a-crafted-regular-expression">[CVE-2020-10543] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression</h2>

<p>A signed <code>size_t</code> integer overflow in the storage space calculations for nested regular expression quantifiers could cause a heap buffer overflow in Perl&#39;s regular expression compiler that overwrites memory allocated after the regular expression storage space with attacker supplied data.</p>

<p>The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems.</p>

<p>Discovered by: ManhND of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup).</p>

<h2 id="CVE-2020-10878-Integer-overflow-via-malformed-bytecode-produced-by-a-crafted-regular-expression">[CVE-2020-10878] Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced by a crafted regular expression</h2>

<p>Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the regular expression engine could cause corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression. An attacker could abuse this behaviour to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression.</p>

<p>Discovered by: Hugo van der Sanden and Slaven Rezic.</p>

<h2 id="CVE-2020-12723-Buffer-overflow-caused-by-a-crafted-regular-expression">[CVE-2020-12723] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression</h2>

<p>Recursive calls to <code>S_study_chunk()</code> by Perl&#39;s regular expression compiler to optimize the intermediate language representation of a regular expression could cause corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression.</p>

<p>Discovered by: Sergey Aleynikov.</p>

<h2 id="Additional-Note">Additional Note</h2>

<p>An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the above flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="Certain-pattern-matching-features-are-now-prohibited-in-compiling-Unicode-property-value-wildcard-subpatterns">Certain pattern matching features are now prohibited in compiling Unicode property value wildcard subpatterns</h2>

<p>These few features are either inappropriate or interfere with the algorithm used to accomplish this task. The complete list is in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#Wildcards-in-Property-Values">&quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in perlunicode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Unused-functions-POSIX::mbstowcs-and-POSIX::wcstombs-are-removed">Unused functions <code>POSIX::mbstowcs</code> and <code>POSIX::wcstombs</code> are removed</h2>

<p>These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface specification. There is clearly no demand for them, given that no one has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be available, hence so-called &quot;support&quot; for them is now dropped.</p>

<h2 id="A-bug-fix-for-...-may-have-caused-some-patterns-to-no-longer-compile">A bug fix for <code>(?[...])</code> may have caused some patterns to no longer compile</h2>

<p>See <a href="#Selected-Bug-Fixes">&quot;Selected Bug Fixes&quot;</a>. The heuristics previously used may have let some constructs compile (perhaps not with the programmer&#39;s intended effect) that should have been errors. None are known, but it is possible that some erroneous constructs no longer compile.</p>

<h2 id="p-user-defined-properties-now-always-override-official-Unicode-ones"><code>\p{<i>user-defined</i>}</code> properties now always override official Unicode ones</h2>

<p>Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior to the compilation of the regular expression pattern that contains it, its definition was used instead of any official Unicode property with the same name. Now, it always overrides the official property. This change could break existing code that relied (likely unwittingly) on the previous behavior. Without this fix, if Unicode released a new version with a new property that happens to have the same name as the one you had long been using, your program would break when you upgraded to a perl that used that new Unicode version. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Character-Properties">&quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode</a>. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17205">GH #17205</a>]</p>

<h2 id="Modifiable-variables-are-no-longer-permitted-in-constants">Modifiable variables are no longer permitted in constants</h2>

<p>Code like:</p>

<pre><code>    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var };</code></pre>

<p>where <code>$var</code> is referenced elsewhere in some sort of modifiable context now produces an exception when the sub is defined.</p>

<p>This error can be avoided by adding a return to the sub definition:</p>

<pre><code>    $sub = sub () { return $var };</code></pre>

<p>This has been deprecated since Perl 5.22. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134138">perl #134138</a>]</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-vec-on-strings-with-code-points-above-0xFF-is-forbidden">Use of <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlfunc.html#vec-EXPR-OFFSET-BITS"><code>vec</code></a> on strings with code points above 0xFF is forbidden</h2>

<p>Such strings are represented internally in UTF-8, and <code>vec</code> is a bit-oriented operation that will likely give unexpected results on those strings. This was deprecated in perl 5.28.0.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-code-points-over-0xFF-in-string-bitwise-operators">Use of code points over 0xFF in string bitwise operators</h2>

<p>Some uses of these were already illegal after a previous deprecation cycle. The remaining uses are now prohibited, having been deprecated in perl 5.28.0. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldeprecation.html">perldeprecation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Sys::Hostname::hostname-does-not-accept-arguments"><code>Sys::Hostname::hostname()</code> does not accept arguments</h2>

<p>This usage was deprecated in perl 5.28.0 and is now fatal.</p>

<h2 id="Plain-0-string-now-treated-as-a-number-for-range-operator">Plain &quot;0&quot; string now treated as a number for range operator</h2>

<p>Previously a range <code>&quot;0&quot; .. &quot;-1&quot;</code> would produce a range of numeric strings from &quot;0&quot; through &quot;99&quot;; this now produces an empty list, just as <code>0 .. -1</code> does. This also means that <code>&quot;0&quot; .. &quot;9&quot;</code> now produces a list of integers, where previously it would produce a list of strings.</p>

<p>This was due to a special case that treated strings starting with &quot;0&quot; as strings so ranges like <code>&quot;00&quot; .. &quot;03&quot;</code> produced <code>&quot;00&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, &quot;02&quot;, &quot;03&quot;</code>, but didn&#39;t specially handle the string <code>&quot;0&quot;</code>. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133695">perl #133695</a>]</p>

<h2 id="K-now-disallowed-in-look-ahead-and-look-behind-assertions"><code>\K</code> now disallowed in look-ahead and look-behind assertions</h2>

<p>This was disallowed because it causes unexpected behaviour, and no-one could define what the desired behaviour should be. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124256">perl #124256</a>]</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<li><p><code>my_strnlen</code> has been sped up for systems that don&#39;t have their own <code>strnlen</code> implementation.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>grok_bin_oct_hex</code> (and so, <code>grok_bin</code>, <code>grok_oct</code>, and <code>grok_hex</code>) have been sped up.</p>

<h3 id="perldebguts"><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldebguts.html">perldebguts</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><p>Simplify a few regnode definitions</p>

<p>Update <code>BOUND</code> and <code>NBOUND</code> definitions.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Add ANYOFHs regnode</p>

<p>This node is like <code>ANYOFHb</code>, but is used when more than one leading byte is the same in all the matched code points.</p>

<p><code>ANYOFHb</code> is used to avoid having to convert from UTF-8 to code point for something that won&#39;t match. It checks that the first byte in the UTF-8 encoded target is the desired one, thus ruling out most of the possible code points.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perlapi"><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html">perlapi</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><p><code>sv_2pvbyte</code> updated to mention it will croak if the SV cannot be downgraded.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>sv_setpvn</code> updated to mention that the UTF-8 flag will not be changed by this function, and a terminating NUL byte is guaranteed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Documentation for <code>PL_phase</code> has been added.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The documentation for <code>grok_bin</code>, <code>grok_oct</code>, and <code>grok_hex</code> has been updated and clarified.</p>

<li><p><i>Configure</i> now correctly handles gcc-10. Previously it was interpreting it as gcc-1 and turned on <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl now no longer probes for <code>d_u32align</code>, defaulting to <code>define</code> on all platforms. This check was error-prone when it was done, which was on 32-bit platforms only. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133495">perl #133495</a>]</p>

On systems with that patch kit installed, Perl&#39;s configuration process will now detect the presence of the header <code>stdint.h</code> and the following functions: <code>fpclassify</code>, <code>isblank</code>, <code>isless</code>, <code>llrint</code>, <code>llrintl</code>, <code>llround</code>, <code>llroundl</code>, <code>nearbyint</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>scalbn</code>, and <code>scalbnl</code>.</p>

<dt id="z-OS">z/OS</dt>
<dd>

<p>Perl 5.32 has been tested on z/OS 2.4, with the following caveats:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Only static builds (the default) build reliably</p>

</li>
<li><p>When using locales, z/OS does not handle the <code>LC_MESSAGES</code> category properly, so when compiling perl, you should add the following to your <i>Configure</i> options</p>

<pre><code> ./Configure &lt;other options&gt; -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_MESSAGES</code></pre>

</li>
<li><p>z/OS does not support locales with threads, so when compiling a threaded perl, you should add the following to your <i>Configure</i> options</p>

<pre><code> ./Configure &lt;other Configure options&gt; -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE</code></pre>

</li>
<li><p>Some CPAN modules that are shipped with perl fail at least one of their self-tests. These are: Archive::Tar, Config::Perl::V, CPAN::Meta, CPAN::Meta::YAML, Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA, Encode, ExtUtils::MakeMaker, ExtUtils::Manifest, HTTP::Tiny, IO::Compress, IPC::Cmd, JSON::PP, libnet, MIME::Base64, Module::Metadata, PerlIO::via-QuotedPrint, Pod::Checker, podlators, Pod::Simple, Socket, and Test::Harness.</p>

<p>The causes of the failures range from the self-test itself is flawed, and the module actually works fine, up to the module doesn&#39;t work at all on EBCDIC platforms.</p>

</li>
</ul>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><code>savepvn</code>&#39;s len parameter is now a <code>Size_t</code> instead of an <code>I32</code> since we can handle longer strings than 31 bits.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The lexer (<code>Perl_yylex()</code> in <i>toke.c</i>) was previously a single 4100-line function, relying heavily on <code>goto</code> and a lot of widely-scoped local variables to do its work. It has now been pulled apart into a few dozen smaller static functions; the largest remaining chunk (<code>yyl_word_or_keyword()</code>) is a little over 900 lines, and consists of a single <code>switch</code> statement, all of whose <code>case</code> groups are independent. This should be much easier to understand and maintain.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The OS-level signal handlers and type (Sighandler_t) used by the perl core were declared as having three parameters, but the OS was always told to call them with one argument. This has been fixed by declaring them to have one parameter. See the merge commit <code>v5.31.5-346-g116e19abbf</code> for full details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The code that handles <code>tr///</code> has been extensively revised, fixing various bugs, especially when the source and/or replacement strings contain characters whose code points are above 255. Some of the bugs were undocumented, one being that under some circumstances (but not all) with <code>/s</code>, the squeezing was done based on the source, rather than the replacement. A documented bug that got fixed was [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125493">perl #125493</a>].</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new macro for XS writers dealing with UTF-8-encoded Unicode strings has been created <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#UTF8_CHK_SKIP">&quot;<code>UTF8_CHK_SKIP</code>&quot; in perlapi</a> that is safer in the face of malformed UTF-8 input than <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#UTF8_SKIP">&quot;<code>UTF8_SKIP</code>&quot; in perlapi</a> (but not as safe as <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#UTF8_SAFE_SKIP">&quot;<code>UTF8_SAFE_SKIP</code>&quot; in perlapi</a>). It won&#39;t read past a NUL character. It has been backported in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Devel/PPPort.html">Devel::PPPort</a> 3.55 and later.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added the <code>PL_curstackinfo-&gt;si_cxsubix</code> field. This records the stack index of the most recently pushed sub/format/eval context. It is set and restored automatically by <code>cx_pushsub()</code>, <code>cx_popsub()</code> etc., but would need to be manually managed if you do any unusual manipulation of the context stack.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Various macros dealing with character type classification and changing case where the input is encoded in UTF-8 now require an extra parameter to prevent potential reads beyond the end of the buffer. Use of these has generated a deprecation warning since Perl 5.26. Details are in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldeprecation.html#In-XS-code-use-of-various-macros-dealing-with-UTF-8">&quot;In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.&quot; in perldeprecation</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>A new parser function <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#parse_subsignature">parse_subsignature()</a> allows a keyword plugin to parse a subroutine signature while <code>use feature &#39;signatures&#39;</code> is in effect. This allows custom keywords to implement semantics similar to regular <code>sub</code> declarations that include signatures. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132474">perl #132474</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Since on some platforms we need to hold a mutex when temporarily switching locales, new macros (<code>STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN</code>, <code>WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED</code> and <code>WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN</code>) have been added to make it easier to do this safely and efficiently as part of [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134172">perl #134172</a>].</p>

</li>
<li><p>The memory bookkeeping overhead for allocating an OP structure has been reduced by 8 bytes per OP on 64-bit systems.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#eval_pv">eval_pv()</a> no longer stringifies the exception when <code>croak_on_error</code> is true. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134175">perl #134175</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>The PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable was formerly only honoured on perl binaries built with DEBUGGING support. It is now checked on all perl builds. Its normal use is to force perl to individually free every block of memory which it has allocated before exiting, which is useful when using automated leak detection tools such as valgrind.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The API eval_sv() now accepts a <code>G_RETHROW</code> flag. If this flag is set and an exception is thrown while compiling or executing the supplied code, it will be rethrown, and eval_sv() will not return. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134177">perl #134177</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>As part of the fix for [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2754">perl #2754</a>] perl_parse() now returns non-zero if exit(0) is called in a <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>UNITCHECK</code> or <code>CHECK</code> block.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Most functions which recursively walked an op tree during compilation have been made non-recursive. This avoids SEGVs from stack overflow when the op tree is deeply nested, such as <code>$n == 1 ? &quot;one&quot; : $n == 2 ? &quot;two&quot; : ....</code> (especially in code which is auto-generated).</p>

<p>This is particularly noticeable where the code is compiled within a separate thread, as threads tend to have small stacks by default.</p>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Previously <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlfunc.html#require">&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc</a> would only treat the special built-in SV <code>&amp;PL_sv_undef</code> as a value in <code>%INC</code> as if a previous <code>require</code> has failed, treating other undefined SVs as if the previous <code>require</code> has succeeded. This could cause unexpected success from <code>require</code> e.g., on <code>local %INC = %INC;</code>. This has been fixed. [<a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17428">GH #17428</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl no longer treats strings starting with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0b&quot; as hex or binary numbers respectively when converting a string to a number. This reverts a change in behaviour inadvertently introduced in perl 5.30.0 intended to improve precision when converting a string to a floating point number. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134230">perl #134230</a>]</p>

</li>

</li>
<li><p>Exceptions thrown while <code>$@</code> is read-only could result in infinite recursion as perl tried to update <code>$@</code>, which throws another exception, resulting in a stack overflow. Perl now replaces <code>$@</code> with a copy if it&#39;s not a simple writable SV. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134266">perl #134266</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Setting <code>$)</code> now properly sets supplementary group ids if you have the necessary privileges. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134169">perl #134169</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>close() on a pipe now preemptively clears the PerlIO object from the IO SV. This prevents a second attempt to close the already closed PerlIO object if a signal handler calls die() or exit() while close() is waiting for the child process to complete. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122112">perl #122112</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>sprintf(&quot;%.*a&quot;, -10000, $x)</code> would cause a buffer overflow due to mishandling of the negative precision value. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134008">perl #134008</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>scalar() on a reference could cause an erroneous assertion failure during compilation. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134045">perl #134045</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>%{^CAPTURE_ALL}</code> is now an alias to <code>%-</code> as documented, rather than incorrectly an alias for <code>%+</code>. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131867">perl #131867</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>%{^CAPTURE}</code> didn&#39;t work if <code>@{^CAPTURE}</code> was mentioned first. Similarly for <code>%{^CAPTURE_ALL}</code> and <code>@{^CAPTURE_ALL}</code>, though <code>@{^CAPTURE_ALL}</code> currently isn&#39;t used. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134193">perl #134193</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Extraordinarily large (over 2GB) floating point format widths could cause an integer overflow in the underlying call to snprintf(), resulting in an assertion. Formatted floating point widths are now limited to the range of int, the return value of snprintf(). [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133913">perl #133913</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Parsing the following constructs within a sub-parse (such as with <code>&quot;${code here}&quot;</code> or <code>s/.../code here/e</code>) has changed to match how they&#39;re parsed normally:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><code>print $fh ...</code> no longer produces a syntax error.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Code like <code>s/.../ ${time} /e</code> now properly produces an &quot;Ambiguous use of ${time} resolved to $time at ...&quot; warning when warnings are enabled.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>@x {&quot;a&quot;}</code> (with the space) in a sub-parse now properly produces a &quot;better written as&quot; warning when warnings are enabled.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Attributes can now be used in a sub-parse. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133850">perl #133850</a>]</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>Incomplete hex and binary literals like <code>0x</code> and <code>0b</code> are now treated as if the <code>x</code> or <code>b</code> is part of the next token. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134125">perl #134125</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>A spurious <code>)</code> in a subparse, such as in <code>s/.../code here/e</code> or <code>&quot;...${code here}&quot;</code>, no longer confuses the parser.</p>

<p>Previously a subparse was bracketed with generated <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> tokens, so a spurious <code>)</code> would close the construct without doing the normal subparse clean up, confusing the parser and possible causing an assertion failure.</p>

<p>Such constructs are now surrounded by artificial tokens that can&#39;t be included in the source. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130585">perl #130585</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Reference assignment of a sub, such as <code>\&amp;foo = \&amp;bar;</code>, silently did nothing in the <code>main::</code> package. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134072">perl #134072</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>sv_gets() now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a signal handler. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134035">perl #134035</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>readline @foo</code> now evaluates <code>@foo</code> in scalar context. Previously it would be evaluated in list context, and since readline() pops only one argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left with unexpected values on the stack. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133989">perl #133989</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Parsing incomplete hex or binary literals was changed in 5.31.1 to treat such a literal as just the 0, leaving the following <code>x</code> or <code>b</code> to be parsed as part of the next token. This could lead to some silent changes in behaviour, so now incomplete hex or binary literals produce a fatal error. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134125">perl #134125</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>eval_pv()&#39;s <i>croak_on_error</i> flag will now throw even if the exception is a false overloaded value. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134177">perl #134177</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>INIT</code> blocks and the program itself are no longer run if exit(0) is called within a <code>BEGIN</code>, <code>UNITCHECK</code> or <code>CHECK</code> block. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2754">perl #2754</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&gt;+&quot;, undef</code> now opens the temporary file in append mode: writes will seek to the end of file before writing. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134221">perl #134221</a>]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a SEGV when searching for the source of an uninitialized value warning on an op whose subtree includes an OP_MULTIDEREF. [<a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134275">perl #134275</a>]</p>
